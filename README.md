### `useSelector`

[useSelector] is a hook provided by the react-redux library, which is used for accessing the Redux store state from a React component.

It is a replacement for the connect higher-order component (HOC) from the previous version of react-redux, which can make it easier and more concise to extract data from the Redux store in functional components.

The useSelector hook takes a selector function as its argument, which is used to extract the desired data from the store. The selector function is called with the entire store state as its argument, and should return only the relevant portion of the state that the component needs.
