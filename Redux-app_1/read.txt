Redux manage the application state,
arcture flow: view -> action update state -> reducer -> put into store
Action: (type, payload)
: with the help of action only change the state 
reducer: (state, action)

when action is type of async, then we use redux middleware such as thunk or saga
:reducer always return a default state

dispatch is nothing but action event, reducer is act as a listner

reducer is the function
// reducer is for previous state and perfrom action on it

reducer return inital state until the action is not perform,
if action perform then, return give update state.(important)

// State: it a object like nested tree
// action: performing any type of action goes to reducer

//dispatch is a function provided by Redux that allows you to send actions to the Redux store. It is the primary way to trigger state changes in a Redux application
