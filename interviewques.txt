Lazy loading: 
Implement lazy loading for images, especially if you have a large number of images or if they are not all visible on the screen at once. Load images only when they are about to become visible to the user, and unload them when they are no longer visible.

-------------------------------------------------------------

1) Normal variables are used to store data in a component, but they do not have any built-in functionality to handle component state changes.
React hooks, on the other hand, are functions that allow you to use state and other React features in functional components.

Normal Variables:

Scope: Normal variables have a specific scope, such as function scope or global scope. They are typically defined within a specific function or block and are accessible only within that scope.
State Management: Normal variables do not have built-in state management capabilities. When their values change, there is no automatic mechanism to trigger re-rendering or propagate those changes to other components.
Lifecycle: Normal variables do not have an inherent understanding of component lifecycle. They do not have hooks like "componentDidMount" or "componentWillUnmount" to handle specific actions when a component mounts or unmounts.
Reactivity: Normal variables do not possess reactivity. If you modify a normal variable's value, React will not be aware of the change and won't re-render the component.
React Hooks:

useState: React hooks, such as useState, allow you to manage state within functional components. They provide a way to define and update state variables that trigger re-rendering when their values change.
useEffect: Another important hook is useEffect, which enables you to perform side effects or manage subscriptions within functional components. It is used to replicate the functionality of lifecycle methods like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount.
Component-level State: React hooks allow you to maintain state within a component, similar to class-based components. This local state can be easily accessed and updated within the component's function body.
Rules and Guidelines: React hooks follow certain rules to ensure they are used correctly. For example, hooks must always be called at the top level of a component, not inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.

#useContext:
As mentioned earlier, useContext allows you to share state and functionality across components without prop drilling. While it's suitable for simpler scenarios, it might become less scalable and harder to manage for larger applications. Here's an example:

Real-life example: Imagine you have a user authentication feature in your application. You can create an AuthContext using createContext and define a AuthProvider component that handles authentication logic and provides the authentication state and related functions. Then, you can use useContext(AuthContext) in any component that needs access to the authenticated user's information, such as displaying user-specific data or conditionally rendering certain components based on authentication status.

#Redux:
Redux is a popular state management library that provides a predictable state container for JavaScript applications. It is particularly useful for complex applications with large amounts of shared state and actions that need to be dispatched across different components.

Real-life example: Let's consider a social media application where users can create posts, like posts, and follow other users. You can use Redux to manage the global state of the application. For instance, you can have a Redux store with reducers for managing user information, posts, and likes. Actions can be dispatched to modify the state, such as adding a new post, updating the user's information, or incrementing the number of likes on a specific post. Components can then subscribe to the relevant parts of the Redux store using connect or hooks like useSelector and useDispatch to access the state and dispatch actions accordingly.

Redux provides a more centralized and scalable approach to state management, especially when dealing with large and interconnected applications. It offers advanced features like middleware and dev tools integration, making it easier to debug and trace the flow of state changes throughout the application.


A real-life example of useContext could be a multi-step form where user data needs to be passed between different pages or steps of the form. Instead of passing the data through props, useContext can be used to create a global context that can be accessed by any component in the form.

A real-life example of Redux could be an e-commerce website where user data such as cart items, shipping information, and payment details need to be accessed and updated by multiple components such as the cart page, checkout page, and confirmation page. Redux can be used to create a global store that holds all this data and can be accessed by any component that needs it.

"On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as live code editing combined with a time-traveling debugger."
"esay of debugging with redux"

Real-life example: Let's say you are building a form where users can update their profile information. Instead of using separate useState hooks for each input field, you can use the useReducer hook to manage the state of the entire form. The reducer function can handle different actions like "UPDATE_NAME," "UPDATE_EMAIL," etc., and update the corresponding state values accordingly.

In React Native, the AsyncStorage API provides a simple way to persist key-value data asynchronously. However, it's important to note that AsyncStorage is not designed to be a secure storage solution by default. Here are a few considerations regarding the security of AsyncStorage:

Encryption: AsyncStorage does not provide built-in encryption for stored data. Therefore, sensitive information stored using AsyncStorage can be accessed by anyone who gains unauthorized access to the device or the application's storage.

Device-level Security: The security of data stored in AsyncStorage relies on the underlying security measures of the device. If a user's device is compromised or jailbroken, the stored data can potentially be accessed.

Sensitive Data Handling: It is generally recommended not to store highly sensitive information, such as passwords, authentication tokens, or sensitive user data, directly in AsyncStorage. Instead, consider using more secure storage options, such as secure keychains or encrypted local storage libraries.

Encryption Libraries: To enhance the security of stored data, you can utilize third-party encryption libraries in conjunction with AsyncStorage. These libraries allow you to encrypt the data before storing it in AsyncStorage and decrypt it when retrieving it, providing an additional layer of protection.

In React Native, the keychain refers to a secure storage mechanism provided by the operating system that allows developers to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, authentication tokens, or cryptographic keys. It is specifically designed to protect this sensitive data from unauthorized access on the device.

React Native provides a module called react-native-keychain that serves as a bridge between the React Native application and the underlying operating system's keychain services. This module allows developers to securely store and retrieve sensitive data in a cross-platform manner, as it abstracts away the differences between iOS Keychain and Android KeyStore.

By utilizing the react-native-keychain module, developers can securely store sensitive data in the keychain, which benefits from the underlying security features provided by the operating system. These features may include encryption, secure hardware storage, biometric authentication (such as Touch ID or Face ID), and access controls.

Using the keychain in React Native ensures that sensitive information remains encrypted and protected from unauthorized access, even if the device is compromised or jailbroken. It is particularly useful when handling credentials, session tokens, or any other sensitive data that needs to be stored securely on the device.
