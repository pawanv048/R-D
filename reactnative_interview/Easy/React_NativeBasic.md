**Props**
 props (short for properties) are a mechanism for passing data from a parent component to a child component.
 1. Passing Props
 2. Accessing Props
 3. Dynamic Props: Props are not limited to static values; you can also pass dynamic values or functions
 4. Default Props: You can also specify default values for props in case they are not provided
