### Data types in javascript

JavaScript has 8 Datatypes
1. String
2. Number
3. Bigint
4. Boolean
5. Undefined
6. Null
7. Symbol
8. Object

The Object Datatype
The object data type can contain:

1. An object
2. An array
3. A date



### Primitive data types are the basic building blocks of JavaScript. 
They are immutable, meaning that they cannot be changed once they have been created. There are seven primitive data types in JavaScript:

+ Number: A numeric value, such as 1, 2, or 3.14.
+ String: A sequence of characters, such as "Hello, world!".
+ Boolean: A logical value, either true or false.
+ Null: A special value that indicates the absence of a value.
+ Undefined: A special value that indicates that a variable has not yet been assigned a value.
+ Symbol: A unique value that can be used to identify objects and properties.
+ BigInt: An integer with more than 53 bits of precision.

### Non-primitive data types are objects that are created by the JavaScript engine. They are mutable, meaning that they can be changed once they have been created. There are two main types of non-primitive data types in JavaScript:

Object: A collection of key-value pairs.
Array: An ordered collection of values.
